MAIN HEADER
-----------
Title: ReFocused
Subtitle: An End-to-End AI Productivity Platform

Summary:
A full-stack application with a custom 1.2B parameter LLM, a high-performance
FastAPI backend, and a modern Next.js frontend.

================================================================================

PAPER 1 - FRONTEND
------------------
Header: FRONTEND
Tech Stack: Next.js 15 • React 19 • TypeScript

Content:
• Developed responsive web app using
  Next.js 15, React 19, strict TypeScript

• Designed scalable state with TanStack
  Query + React Context, no prop-drilling

• Engineered secure auth with silent token
  refresh, dual-strategy (Cookies/JWT)

• Built 67+ reusable components: Quill.js
  editor w/ encryption, SVG meditation tool

• Implemented multi-layer caching with
  React Query + localStorage for sub-second UI

PAPER 2 - BACKEND API
---------------------
Header: BACKEND API
Tech Stack: FastAPI • Python • PostgreSQL • Redis

Content:
• Developed async-first API with FastAPI
  + asyncpg: 140+ endpoints, less than 50ms avg

• Implemented multi-layer security: HTTP-Only
  Cookies, Google OAuth 2.0, CSRF protection

• Designed observability stack: OpenTelemetry,
  Prometheus, Sentry to monitor app health

• Deployed with multi-stage Docker build
  for secure, non-root production containers

• Utilized async Redis cache to optimize
  PostgreSQL: queries, sessions, rate limits

PAPER 3 - AI MODEL
------------------
Header: AI MODEL
Tech Stack: 1.2B Params • GPT-NeoX • PyTorch

Content:
• Built and trained a 1.2B param LLM
  from scratch to power AI-driven features

• Built an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for
  data collection, cleaning, and tokenization

• Implemented fault-tolerant PyTorch training:
  mixed-precision, non-blocking GCS uploads

• Designed LoRA fine-tuning workflows to
  specialize for chat and instruction-following

• Engineered data pipeline in Python to parse,
  clean, shard datasets into .npz for training
